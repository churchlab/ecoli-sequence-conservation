            The Escherichia coli B7A whole genome shotgun (WGS) project has the
            project accession AAJT00000000.  This version of the project (02)
            has the accession number AAJT02000000, and consists of sequences
            AAJT02000001-AAJT02000289.
            Escherichia coli B7A is a standard enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)
            isolate that was obtained from Maj. Carl Brinkley (Walter Reed Army
            Institute of Research). ETEC is the leading cause of traveler's
            diarrhea, which is chiefly characterized by a large volume of
            watery diarrhea. ETEC primarily colonizes the small intestine by
            way of the pili. Additionally, two toxins are thought to be
            responsible for the virulence: heat-stable and heat-labile
            enterotoxins. The stock used for genomic DNA preparation was
            obtained from a master- and production cGMP cell bank available at
            WRAIR/NMRC. Pathogenicity has been confirmed in human challenge
            experiments. Other known virulence factors include: serotype
            O148:H28, heat-stable toxin and heat-labile toxin, and CFA type
            CS6. Additionally, this isolate contains multiple plasmids.
