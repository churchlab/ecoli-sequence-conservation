COMMENT     On Jul 24, 2008 this sequence version replaced gi:83416642.
            The Shigella dysenteriae 1012 whole genome shotgun (WGS) project
            has the project accession AAMJ00000000.  This version of the
            project (02) has the accession number AAMJ02000000, and consists of
            sequences AAMJ02000001-AAMJ02000189.
            Shigella dysenteriae 1012 was isolated in Bangledesh and provided
            by Maj. Carl Brinkley (Walter Reed Army Institute of Research).
            This strain is representative of the Type 4 group of S. dysenteriae
            that is becoming more prevalent in human infections. There has been
            a temporal shift in dominance from 1999-2002 of S. dysenteriae
            towards type 4 and type 2 strains from other types previously
            identified.  Pathogenicity has been confirmed in human challenge
            experiments and S. dysenteriae 1012 has been shown to be one of the
            most virulent S. dysenteriae strains identified by WRAIR/NMRC to
            date. This strain contains multiple plasmids thought to be involved
            in virulence.
