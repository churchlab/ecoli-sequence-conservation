            The Escherichia coli 101-1 whole genome shotgun (WGS) project has
            the project accession AAMK00000000.  This version of the project
            (02) has the accession number AAMK02000000, and consists of
            sequences AAMK02000001-AAMK02000091.
            Escherichia coli 101-1 is a member of the enteroaggregative E. coli
            (EAEC) group of pathogens.  Enteroaggregative E. coli is an
            emerging diarrheal pathogen, implicated in traveler's diarrhea and
            endemic diarrhea in developing and industrialized countries. The
            pathogenesis of EAEC infection comprises colonization of the
            intestinal mucosa with elaboration of enterotoxins and cytotoxins.
            E. coli 101-1 was provided by Dr. James Nataro (The University of
            Maryland School of Medicine) and isolated from an outbreak in
            Japan. It is an atypical EAEC isolate.  E. coli 101-1 does not
            contain any of the previously identified EAEC virulence factors;
            however, it causes a disease that is similar to that caused by
            other EAEC isolates.
