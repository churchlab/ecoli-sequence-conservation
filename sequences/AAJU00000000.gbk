            The Escherichia coli F11 whole genome shotgun (WGS) project has the
            project accession AAJU00000000.  This version of the project (02)
            has the accession number AAJU02000000, and consists of sequences
            AAJU02000001-AAJU02000119.
            Escherichia coli F11 was originally isolated from a 20 year old
            woman presenting her first case of cystitis with bacteruria (10e5
            fcu/ml) (Stapleton AE et al, J, Infect. Dis. (1991),163:773-779).
            Cystitis is the infection of the bladder with no involvement of the
            kidneys or other internal organs. Common causes of cystitis include
            E. coli and Proteus mirabilis. The E. coli F11 strain was provided
            for sequencing by Dr. H.L.T. Mobley (University of Michigan,
            Department of Microbiology). E. coli F11 is a member of the
            extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), which include E. coli
            infections in the kidneys and cerebral spinal fluid. Known
            virulence factors include: serotype O6:H31, mannose-resistant
            hemagglutinins (MRHA/S, MRHA/H), hemolysin (phenotype and colony
            blot positive), production of aerobactin, pap-pili, and a papG III
            allele. E. coli F11 has been shown to colonize the urinary tracts
            of a number of mouse models (Johnson D et al, Infection and
            Immunity (1998), 66: 3059).
