            The Escherichia coli 53638 whole genome shotgun (WGS) project has
            the project accession AAKB00000000.  This version of the project
            (02) has the accession number AAKB02000000, and consists of
            sequences AAKB02000001-AAKB02000002.
            Escherichia coli 53638 is an enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) isolate
            that was obtained from Maj. Carl Brinkley (Walter Reed Army
            Institute of Research).  This isolate represents a midpoint between
            E. coli and Shigella species. Based on phenotypic and biochemical
            evidences the strain is more similar to E. coli than Shigella. The
            strain is positive for the IpaB protein as determined by western
            blot. IpaB is involved in vacuole lysis and intracellular survival
            by Shigella species. The infection of enteroinvasive E. coli is
            similar to that of Shigella, with an intracellular stage of
            replication and cell-to-cell spread. Other features include
            Serotype O144,  the inability to utilize lactose, and the lack of
            toxin prodution. This isolate contains two plasmids typically found
            in Shigella  species. The stock used for genomic DNA preparation
            was obtained from a master- and production cGMP cell bank available
            at WRAIR/NMRC.  Pathogenicity has been confirmed in human challenge
            experiments
            Annotation was added to the contigs in May 2008.
            The complete plasmids  p53638_226 and p53638_75 were deposited in
            GenBank Accession Numbers CP001064 and CP001065, respectively.
