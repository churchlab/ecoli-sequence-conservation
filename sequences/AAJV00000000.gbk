            The Escherichia coli E22 whole genome shotgun (WGS) project has the
            project accession AAJV00000000.  This version of the project (02)
            has the accession number AAJV02000000, and consists of sequences
            AAJV02000001-AAJV02000127.
            Escherichia coli E22 is a strain of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)
            that has been used in the development of the model system of
            infection in rabbits.  EPEC infection is primarily in infants and
            usually limited to the small intestine, but in some cases causes
            hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or hemorrhagic colitis (HC).  E.
            coli E22 was provided by Drs. James B. Kaper and Edward Boedeker
            (University of Maryland School of Medicine).  Known virulence
            factors include: serotype O103:H2, LEE pathogenicity island (Type
            II secretion system with secreted factors leading to the typical AE
            lesions of the epithelial layer).
